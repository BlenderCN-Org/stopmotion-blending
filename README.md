# stopmotion-blending
A blender 3d addon with a collection of tools assisting with stopmotion animation

# Features (and wish-list)

**Nothing has yet been implemented, so this is a wish-list**

- Watch folder
  - While enabled, folders can be selected (enabled/toggled) under a list view to mark as being watched. This is then used elsewhere by the addon.
  - Would also be nice to have the ability to auto load folders or have saved "project" sets of folders from preferences
- Sequence refreshing
  - For watched folders, try to auto refresh the sequence with newest frames as a folder is updated
- Sequence re-ordering
  - An operator that when used, will re-sequence any selected watch folders given a base naming convention, so that any deleted frames or lapses in numbers generated by the camera are resolved into a sequential list of image file frames.
  - It could also handle in a special way "deleted frames" or "retakes" with a prefix
- Stopmotion frame operators
  - Delete a frame
  - Copy a frame forward/backwards
  - Retake a frame
  - Keep track of parallel angles/cameras, for multi cam. If two sequences are selected to operate in parallel, functions such as frame insertion, re-sequencing etc should 
  - Onion skinning
    - Again, if sequence setup in meta strip, this could be somewhat easily acocmplished by layered opacity strips. May have slow playback, though could use proxies for the faded out onion frames.
- Self-managed caching and resolutions
  - If enabled, auto create low resolution image sequences
  - If enabled, auto create (and update at time of blend-file saving) a low res movie of the sequence
- Image capture
  - Stretch goal, making use of existing python libraries to directly control remote image capture from DSLR's (first priority) and webcams.
  - Note: It is not an intended goal to make a live-capture window, though it may be possible if the addon supplements blender with a dedicated capture window, but this would be clunky and for that usage it would perhaps be better suited to use another stopmotion program.


# Usage

- Right now, only the resequence button works. Select an active image strip in the sequence editor, and press *Resequence* from the N-tab/EditStrip panel. 
  - Note: this does not yet refresh the sequence itself, only renames the files.
  - Note: this operator currently assumes only one image sequence per folder.


# Development notes/structure plans

- It may be wise to not import image frames as sequences, but rather manage the frames inside a sequence meta group. This allows for potentially easier insertions/deleting/adding without having to rename files all the time. 
  - Thus, "resequence" could be an operator which "applies" the naming convention to the captured frames.
- Watch folder/frame refreshing:
  - Have to decide how this will work, but would need to be some kind of lightweight handler that checks e.g. the count of files in a folder periodically (on the order of seconds).
  - This could be accomplished by a background demon thread, or via a handler itself. Pro's and con's of both.



# Additional notes

This is intended to assist creating stopmotion animations leveraging blender (not to be confused with attempts to make CG animation look like stopmotion).
